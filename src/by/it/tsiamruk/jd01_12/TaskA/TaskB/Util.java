    public static String string = "Virtual network peering for Azure Virtual Network lets customers directly link virtual machines in two virtual networks in the same region through private IP addresses, as if they were part of the same network. Virtual network peering routes packets through the internal Azure backbone networkâ€”without any gateway in the path. This allows for low-latency, high-bandwidth connections between virtual machines in different virtual networks. Virtual network peering also allows transit through the peered virtual networks, so a network virtual appliance or a VPN gateway in one virtual network can be used by a virtual machine in another peered virtual network. Peering works across virtual networks in different subscriptions and between an Azure Resource Manager (V2) and Azure Classic (V1) virtual network. It does not work between two Azure Classic virtual networks. For more information, please visit the VNet peering documentation webpage. ";
