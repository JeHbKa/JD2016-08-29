    static String englishText = "Java SE 8 may be one of the most profound Java releases in its 14-year history. When Java was released in 1996 and adopted by the masses in the form of applets (and later Servlets, JSP, and even user interfaces), the consumer computer world was a different place. Most of us had a single CPU in our computers with a single core. Java worked well on a single CPU and, as time and technology evolved, we developed ways to manage concurrency. Java was multi-threaded from its inception, and it implemented a lock-based synchronization strategy for managing access to shared data.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "But that was then, this is now. Most of us have multiple CPUs with multiple cores on our desktops, and our servers have even more power. Furthermore, with the advent of the cloud, distributed and parallel computing have grown at an unprecedented rate. In order to stay current with the times, parallel computing requires a paradigm shift away from traditional object-oriented programming to a more functional model. Thus, in the past few years we have seen the evolution of new functional programming languages like Scala and Haskel, as well as the reemergence of older functional programming languages like Erlang.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "So what is to become of Java? Java has had a rich history, but if it is to continue to be the language of choice of the mainstream commercial world, it must evolve. And with Java 8, evolve it has!\n" +
            "\n" +
            "This article is not exhaustive in its review of the new features added to Java SE 8 (you can read a more exhaustive  article series here), but it highlights the specific subset of features that modernize the Java programming language with functional programming concepts to allow it meet the demands of modern computing. In other words, if you are going to stay relevant as a Java programmer in the coming years, then these are the new features in Java that you need to understand.";
